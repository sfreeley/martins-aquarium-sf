# martins-aquarium-sf

This project is an addition to the version started by Steve Brownlee, instructor at NSS. This is an example of BEM naming practices, semantic HTML and CSS as well as Flexbox. The importance of starting a thorough and detailed wireframe before commencement of the initial code was emphasized during this project.
